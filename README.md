# 🌹 The Eternal Rose 3D

An interactive, browser-based 3D experience inspired by the classic tale of *Beauty and the Beast*. Built entirely with **Three.js**, this project features a procedurally generated velvet rose encased in a reflective glass dome, surrounded by floating magic dust. 

Move your mouse to guide a glowing fairy of light that dynamically illuminates the petals and the glass!

## ✨ Features

* **Procedural Geometry:** The rose petals, stem, and leaves are constructed dynamically using Three.js mathematical geometries and curves.
* **Advanced Materials:** Utilizes `MeshPhysicalMaterial` for realistic velvet sheen on the petals and light transmission (refraction) through the glass dome.
* **Interactive Lighting:** A dynamic `PointLight` and visual glowing orb map to your screen's cursor coordinates, allowing you to "light up" the scene in real-time.
* **Particle System:** A custom buffer geometry creates a continuous loop of falling, glowing magical dust inside the dome.
* **Zero Build Step:** Uses ES modules and import maps via CDNs, meaning it runs directly in the browser without Webpack, Vite, or Node.js.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3: For the UI overlay and immersive full-screen background.

JavaScript (ES6+): For the core logic and animation loop.

Three.js: (v0.160.0) The WebGL library used to render the 3D scene, materials, and lighting.
